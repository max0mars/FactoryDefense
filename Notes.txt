Features to implement:

- different types of bots (identified by different shapes and colors)
- factory turrets
- upgrade screen
- Different Levels (rougue-lite, complete n levels, mini bosses and final boss)

stat upgrades:
    have an upgrade table stored in main and an apply upgrade function in the robot table

Need a generic structure for entities as things that can be attacked. Need to have hp and takedamage() funciton. Need to have x and y. Need to have a tag.
- factories
- make a generic robot class for all robots to inherit from ()
    How I will implement inheritance:
        specific bot classes hold all the unique stat values and function overides
        any functions or stats that are the same across all bots will go in the parent
