IDEAS:
- Make it more of an RPG
    - each 'level' is a planet
        - Resource extraction planets, Boss fight planets, AI planets (attack instead of defend? to find AI)
    - use resources to upgrade
    - collect, build, upgrade robots (classes, abilities, stats, synergy bonuses)
    - collect turret blueprints to build when defending base, (maybe can be upgraded or maybe static, idk?)
    - Can build and upgrade parts but have to find 'AIs' to control them
    - AIs have control robot husks, have different rarities, abilities, tendencies, get bonus stats when paired with parts from a specific class
- Gameplay could either be rouguelite where if your extractor is destroyed you lose, robots gone forever when dead, etc.
- progression based gameplay where losing has no penalty just grind easy levels to get stronger.

Features to implement:

Need a generic structure for entities as things that can be attacked. Need to have hp and takedamage() funciton. Need to have x and y. Need to have a tag.
- factories
- make a generic robot class for all robots to inherit from ()
    How I will implement inheritance:
        specific bot classes hold all the unique stat values and function overides
        any functions or stats that are the same across all bots will go in the parent
        


House Cleaning:
- make buttons and stuff pretty
